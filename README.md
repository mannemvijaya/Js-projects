🎮 How It Works

A random paragraph is displayed when the game loads.

The timer starts automatically when the user begins typing.

Each typed character is compared with the displayed text:

✅ Correct characters turn light

❌ Incorrect characters turn red

The game calculates:

WPM = (Correct characters ÷ 5) ÷ time

CPM = Total correct characters

Mistakes = Incorrect keystrokes

Click Try Again to reset the game with a new paragraph.
